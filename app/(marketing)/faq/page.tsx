  // General
  {
    category: 'general',
    question: 'How do I become a certified HEVACRAZ member?',
    answer:
      'Register on our platform, submit your qualifications, and complete the verification process. Once approved, you receive your certification and access to all member tools. Start at the Join page to pick the right track for you.',
  },
  {
    category: 'general',
    question: 'Is my payment and personal data secure?',
    answer:
      'Yes. All payments are processed via PCI-DSS-compliant gateways and we never store card details. Personal data is encrypted at rest and in transit, and only authorised HEVACRAZ and NOU reviewers can access your registry record. You can request a full data export or deletion at any time.',
  },

  // Students
  {
    category: 'students',
    question: 'Who qualifies for the $7/year Student plan?',
    answer:
      'Any student currently enrolled at a recognised Polytechnic in Zimbabwe studying HVAC-R, refrigeration, or a related discipline. You will be asked to upload a valid student ID and proof of enrolment during sign-up. Student accounts are verified annually and must be renewed each academic year.',
  },
  {
    category: 'students',
    question: 'What is included in the Student plan?',
    answer:
      'Learning Hub access, the sizing tool, the field toolkit, a basic student registry listing, an entry-level certification path, and discounted pricing on public training sessions. You can upgrade to Professional at any time once you graduate.',
  },
  {
    category: 'students',
    question: 'Can I upgrade from Student to Professional when I graduate?',
    answer:
      'Yes. When your Polytechnic enrolment ends, you can upgrade in-dashboard. CPD credits earned during your student year carry over and count toward your Professional certification assessment. You will be prompted to upload graduation evidence.',
  },
  {
    category: 'students',
    question: 'What happens at the end of each academic year?',
    answer:
      'We verify continued enrolment 30 days before your Student plan anniversary. Upload a fresh student ID or transcript to extend the $7/year pricing. If enrolment has ended, the account converts to a read-only state until you either upgrade to Professional or apply for a different tier.',
  },
  {
    category: 'students',
    question: 'Do I get access to the Certificate of Conformity (COC) tool?',
    answer:
      'Not under the Student plan. COC issuance requires Professional-tier certification so the signing technician carries full legal responsibility. Students can shadow COC work, submit practice entries, and review completed COCs through the Learning Hub.',
  },

  // Technicians
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'What is a COC and when do I need one?',
    answer:
      'A Certificate of Conformity (COC) is a mandatory document that verifies your HVAC-R installation meets Zimbabwean safety and quality standards. It is required for all new installations, modifications, and certain maintenance work involving regulated refrigerants.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'What refrigerants can I legally handle after certification?',
    answer:
      'Certification levels determine the refrigerant classes you are authorised to handle, from lower-GWP A1 synthetics through to flammable hydrocarbons (A3) and ammonia. The Learning Hub and assessments cover each class. The NOU (National Ozone Unit) oversees compliance with the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment requirements.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'How long does certification approval take?',
    answer:
      'Straightforward applications with complete documentation are typically reviewed within 5 to 7 working days. Applications requiring additional evidence or on-site assessment can take up to 21 working days. You can track live status from your dashboard.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'How does the technician registry help me find clients?',
    answer:
      'The public registry is searchable by potential clients seeking verified HVAC-R professionals. Having a complete profile with certifications and reviews significantly increases your visibility and credibility. Businesses verify registry standing before awarding contracts.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'What happens if my certification expires?',
    answer:
      'You receive reminder emails 60, 30, and 7 days before expiry. Once expired, your public registry listing is marked inactive and you lose access to COC issuance and compliance-gated tools until you renew. Renewal requires CPD credits earned through the Learning Hub.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'Do I need formal qualifications to join as a Professional?',
    answer:
      'The Professional tier requires either a recognised trade qualification OR demonstrated experience verified through our assessment process. Apprentices and self-taught technicians can start with the Student tier (if enrolled) or apply directly for assessment, then progress to Professional as they build CPD credits.',
  },
  {
    category: 'technicians',
    question: 'Can I transfer a certification from another country?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Submit your existing credentials through the recognition pathway on your dashboard. The Assessment Committee reviews equivalency against Zimbabwean standards, may request a practical evaluation, and issues a transition certificate if criteria are met. Typical review time: 10 to 14 working days.',
  },

  // Suppliers
  {
    category: 'suppliers',
    question: 'How do I register as a gas supplier?',
    answer:
      'Start at /supplier-register. You submit company details, tax registration, NOU trading licence, and authorised product list. HEVACRAZ reviews first, then the NOU signs off as the second-step approver. Once approved, your account unlocks the Verify Buyer tool and Reorder queue.',
  },
  {
    category: 'suppliers',
    question: 'Can suppliers sell gas to anyone who walks in?',
    answer:
      'No. Registered suppliers must use the Verify Buyer tool before any regulated-refrigerant transaction. It confirms the buyer is a HEVACRAZ-certified technician in good standing. Sales to unregistered buyers are flagged to the NOU automatically and can result in supplier sanctions.',
  },
  {
    category: 'suppliers',
    question: 'How does the two-step reorder approval work?',
    answer:
      'When you submit a refrigerant reorder request, HEVACRAZ reviews first for quota and compliance alignment. If approved, the request moves to the NOU for final sign-off on the gas type and volume. You receive status updates at each step, and the full trail is timestamped for audit purposes.',
  },
  {
    category: 'suppliers',
    question: 'What if I sell to an unregistered buyer by mistake?',
    answer:
      'If the Verify Buyer tool returned "not found" or "revoked" and the sale proceeded anyway, the incident is logged and a compliance officer will contact you within 48 hours. First-time good-faith errors usually result in a training requirement; repeated or wilful sales trigger NOU sanctions and possible de-listing from the supplier directory.',
  },
  {
    category: 'suppliers',
    question: 'What documentation is required to keep supplier status?',
    answer:
      'An annual NOU trading licence renewal, up-to-date insurance, proof of proper refrigerant storage and disposal practices, and clean standing in the reorder audit log. We review supplier credentials every 12 months; lapsed documentation pauses your ability to transact until resolved.',
  },
