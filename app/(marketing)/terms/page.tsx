      'These terms govern access to and use of the HEVACRAZ HVAC-R platform and its public website features. By accessing or using the platform, you agree to follow these terms and applicable law. If you use the platform on behalf of an organisation, you confirm that you are authorised to act for it. If you do not agree, do not use the platform.',
      'These terms are a platform-use notice and do not replace a separate membership, training, employment, supplier, certification, or service agreement. Where an approved agreement conflicts with these terms, the approved agreement governs that specific service to the extent stated in it.',

    title: 'Accounts, invitations, and access',
    bullets: [
      'Provide accurate information, keep it reasonably current, and use only accounts and roles assigned to you through the platform’s authorised process.',
      'Keep passwords, invitation links, and authentication codes private. Tell HEVACRAZ promptly if you suspect unauthorised access or an account was created using your details.',
      'Do not share an account or use another person’s credentials. Access may be limited to the records and actions needed for your role.',
      'HEVACRAZ may correct role or access errors, suspend an account to protect users or records, or revoke access when authorisation ends, subject to applicable law and any required process.',

      'Access records or functions without permission, bypass security, probe or disrupt the service, introduce malicious code, or interfere with another user’s access.',
      'Use the platform to unlawfully discriminate, harass, threaten, expose private information, or send unsolicited or unlawful communications.',
      'Use platform data for an unrelated purpose or export, copy, or republish another person’s information unless authorised and legally permitted.',

    title: 'User-submitted information and records',

You give HEVACRAZ and its authorised service providers permission to host, process, display to authorised users, and use that material only as needed to operate the requested platform features, support association workflows, meet legal duties, and enforce these terms.',
      'You are responsible for having the rights and authority needed to submit the material, including photographs and personal information about other people. Do not upload passwords, payment-card security codes, or information unrelated to the platform purpose.',
      'Records may be used in training, credential, safety, compliance, audit, reporting, or verification workflows. Limited fields may be displayed to other authorised users or, where a public registry or verification feature is enabled, to the public. Do not submit information for publication unless you have read the relevant notice and have authority to do so.',

A platform status, application, or course completion does not itself guarantee admission, approval, professional registration, or issuance of a certificate.',
      'Verification results reflect the records available to the platform at the time of lookup. A result is not a substitute for checking the original credential with its issuer where a decision depends on it.',

      'Sizing tools, refrigerant lookups, risk prompts, checklists, and other technical outputs are general decision-support aids. They depend on user-entered data and stated assumptions and may be incomplete or approximate. They are not a site survey, engineering design, equipment selection, safety data sheet, professional certification, or regulatory approval.',
      'You remain responsible for verifying conditions, current standards, manufacturer instructions, refrigerant identity, and applicable legal requirements with a suitably qualified professional. Do not rely on a platform result where an error could create an immediate risk to health, safety, property, or the environment.',

    title: 'Service availability and third-party services',

HEVACRAZ may restrict access where reasonably necessary to protect the service, users, records, or legal obligations, and will use an appropriate notice or review process where required. Closing an account does not automatically erase records that must be retained for legal, professional, certification, safety, audit, or dispute purposes. Privacy requests remain subject to the Privacy Notice and applicable law.',

Updated terms will be posted here with a revised date; material changes should be notified through an appropriate channel. Continued use after updated terms take effect may constitute acceptance where applicable law permits.',
