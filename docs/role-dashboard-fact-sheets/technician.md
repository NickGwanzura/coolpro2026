# Technician Dashboard: Fact Sheet

**Page:** `/dashboard` (titled "My Dashboard")  |  **Role in system:** `technician`

## Purpose
Daily workspace for a registered HVAC-R technician: see completed jobs, track Certificate of Compliance (COC) requests, log refrigerant recovery, and keep registration, membership and certificates up to date.

## Who it's for
Registered refrigeration and air-conditioning technicians working in the field.

## KPI cards (top row)
| Card | What it shows | Follows the period filter? |
|---|---|---|
| Jobs Completed | Planner jobs marked completed whose scheduled date falls in the period | Yes |
| Pending COCs | COC requests you submitted that an administrator has not yet decided; the approved count is in the note | No, current |
| Refrigerant Recovered | Total kg of your recovery log entries in the period | Yes |
| COCs on Record | Approved Certificates of Compliance you hold; the note says how many expire within 30 days | No, current |

## Panels
- **Getting started checklist.** First steps for someone new: plan a job, log refrigerant use, request a COC, check your membership. It hides itself when everything is done, and can be dismissed.
- **Registration and membership.** Your registry number and status, your membership number and status, and for each the days left until expiry, with a clear warning when something is due or overdue. It also summarises your certificates: how many are valid, expiring within 90 days, or expired. If renewal is due, it tells you to email info@hevacraz.co.zw with your registry number.
- **Upcoming Schedule.** Your next scheduled planner jobs, linking to the Planner tab.
- **Certifications.** Up to five recent COC records with their expiry status.
- **Refrigerant Activity.** A table of your recent gas-log entries (client, action, amount), linking to the Field Toolkit.
